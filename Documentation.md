mEngine Documentation
=====

This documentation exists because there is no development kit for our engine and you might need some basic ideas of how to use the engine writing your own code.

1. History
===

    mEngine's history starts at the end of 2013, more accurately said on the 5th of december. That was the time when the developers of mEngine, two german high school students being in
    the 10th grade at this time, first had the idea to create a 3d java game engine in order to be able to produce games with it later on. Some time later mGameLabs was founded to be the
    official company developing mEngine. The engine has been in development since then and the production will go on.


2. Features
===

2.1 Multidimensional game creation
==

    mEngine gives developers the tools to create good looking games, no matter in which dimension. It is possible to create 2d and 3d games or even mix the two. This gives game engineers
    more freedom in bringing in their whole creativity and makes it easier for them to reach their aims.

2.2 Easy coding for developers
==

    The engine is designed to be simple to understand and to make things easier for those who use it. You will notice this as soon as you start working with it.


3. Game engineering
===

    After all the previous talking, let's get to the actual important thing: creating games.

3.1 3d games
==

    We will start with the creation of 3d games, because it is probably the more important and interesting part.
    To get started, we will first explain how to create game objects. Following to this, there will be shown how to actually get the game objects to do something
    (for example show themselves), and once that is done, we will explain how to use the gui e.g. for creating a menu.
